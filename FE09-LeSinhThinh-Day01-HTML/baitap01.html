    <h1>I like go to swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <p>
        Swimming is my most fravorite activity in the summer. 
        When the sun is shining<br /> and the air is warm, you will find me dipping
        into my backyard. It's not an<br /> impressive pool,only three feet,but it's mine.
    </p>

    <p>There are three reasons I like to swim: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I get lots of exercise.</li>
        <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
        <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
    </ul>
